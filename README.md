A small utility for converting uBiome's JSON data export into a 
user friendly tree graph.

Usage: 

    var ubiometree = require('ubiome-d3-tree.js');
    ubiometree('microbiome.json', '#inner'); 


To view an example, first run `bower install`, fire up a local server 
(e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081`) and open `example/index.html`.
